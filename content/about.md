I'm **lockbox**, I'm an avid tinkerer and memer that likes to take things apart.

## What I Do

- **Reverse Engineering**: Specializing in legacy DSP architectures
- **Vulnerability Research**: Focus on RTOS/DSP bugs and embedded systems
- **Tool Development**: Creator of the Styx emulator and other RE tools
- **Research**: Binary similarity, SMT solving, trace analysis, emulation, egraphs

In my free time I'm interested in:
- Improving the state of embedded system debugging
- Reverse engineering communications equipment and custom protocols
- RTOS "debugging"
- Building better emulation tools for obscure architectures

## Projects

### [Styx Emulator](https://github.com/styx-emulator)
A new ground up emulator that focuses on creating composable and uniform tooling across all targets
and supported systems. Also has a lot of built in tool integration, and is probably one of the
easiest emulators to add target support to.

### [struct.foo](https://github.com/struct-foo)
My personal organization for releasing RE tools, one-off scripts, and research code.
